      content : "City initiators need to clarify their goals, establish teams within one month after authorization, and complete 8 activities within a year, including discussions and competitions, and report to AIGCxChina for publication.
Welcome to copy and hold competitions and activities that have been held, and refer to existing templates. Regional alliances should innovate activities, give full play to the advantages of AIGC, cooperate with the economic and information departments to comply with regulations, and link up with the media to increase exposure. Large-scale activities using the AIGCx brand logo need to be approved by the AIGCxChina Secretariat and authorized. When promoting the application of AIGC technology, it is necessary to comply with laws and regulations, public order, and good customs, avoid risks, and not use AIGCxChina for personal gain. The AIGCxChina Secretariat and AIGCxWenzhou will provide technical guidance and resource support for organizations in various regions, and support cross-city joint activities. For details, please refer to the White Paper."
